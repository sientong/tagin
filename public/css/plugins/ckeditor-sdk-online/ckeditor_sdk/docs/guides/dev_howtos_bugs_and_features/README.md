The [Reporting Issues](#!/guide/dev_issues_readme) session of this guide brings all the necessary information on how to properly report issues.

## How Do I Request New CKEditor Features?

If you feel there is an interesting **feature missing in CKEditor**, go to the development site: [http://dev.ckeditor.com/](http://dev.ckeditor.com/) and file a ticket.

Please make sure you read the [Bug Reporting Instructions](http://dev.ckeditor.com/wiki/Bugs) and [Ticket Specs](http://dev.ckeditor.com/wiki/TicketSpecs) articles beforehand in order to make it easier for the developers to examine the issue. It is also recommended to start from a search at the [community forum](http://cksource.com/forums/) to see whether the proposed functionality has not been implemented yet and offered as a plugin or code sample. You can also start a discussion to see whether the proposed feature could gain some interest from other community members.

When submitting a new ticket, feel free to attach your code suggestions or patches that can serve as a prototype for the requested feature.
