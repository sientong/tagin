This issue has nothing to do with CKEditor, but is related to the security model of the Internet browsers.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to add images to your document, you need to upload them to a server first. You can either upload them to a server manually and then insert them using the <a href=\"http://ckeditor.com/addon/image\">Insert Image</a> feature, giving the URL of the image, or integrate CKEditor with a <a href=\"#!/guide/dev_file_browse_upload\">file browser and uploader</a> like <a href=\"http://ckfinder.com/\">CKFinder</a> and use it to upload the image from your local computer to the server inside the CKEditor interface.</p>\n","title":"File Upload","meta_description":"Most frequently asked question and answers about file upload in CKEditor.","meta_keywords":"ckeditor, editor, wysiwyg, howto, howtos, faq, questions, answers, file, files, upload, uploads, uploading, image, images, manage, management, browser, browse, clipboard, paste, pasting"});
