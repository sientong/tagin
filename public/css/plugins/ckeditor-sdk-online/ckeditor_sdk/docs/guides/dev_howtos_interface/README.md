## How Do I Navigate CKEditor Using the Keyboard?

[CKEditor Accessibility Guide](http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Accessibility) contains lots of useful information on using the CKEditor interface with your keyboard or with assistive devices such as screen readers.

Many functions in CKEditor have their equivalent keyboard shortcuts. This is one of the reasons why working with the editor is simple and efficient.

The [Keyboard Shortcuts](http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Users_Guide/Keyboard_Shortcuts) article describes available keyboard shortcuts grouped by problem areas.


## How Do I Configure CKEditor to Use the `Arrow` Keys to Navigate Between All Toolbar Buttons?

In [CKEditor 3.6](http://ckeditor.com/blog/CKEditor_3.6_released) the concept of **toolbar button groups** was introduced to enable faster and more efficient navigation using the keyboard or assistive devices. In all previous versions of the editor, the `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` keys had the same effect as using the `Right` and `Left Arrow` keys and were used to cycle between consecutive toolbar buttons.

Since CKEditor 3.6, Tab and `Shift+Tab` navigate between toolbar button groups, while the `Arrow` keys are used to cycle between the buttons within a group.

In order to change the new default toolbar navigation mode and use the `Arrow` keys as an equivalent to `Tab` and `Shift+Tab`, use the following {@link CKEDITOR.config#toolbarGroupCycling toolbarGroupCycling} configuration setting:

	config.toolbarGroupCycling = false;
